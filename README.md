# Phone Number and IP Address Information Lookup

This project provides a simple Python-based tool to retrieve information about mobile numbers and IP addresses using external APIs like **NumVerify** for phone number validation and other IP tracking services created by MRGHOSTX94. Below are the steps to install the dependencies and run the script.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, you will need to ensure the following:

- **Python 3.x** is installed on your machine.
- You have **pip** (Python's package installer) available.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrGhostX94/GhostX-Info.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

After cloning the repository, open a terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd GhostX-Info
```

### Step 3: Install Required Dependencies

In the project directory, install the required Python dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can manually install the required dependencies (e.g., `requests`) by running:

```bash
pip install requests
```

### Step 4: Run the Main Script

Now, you can run the main script to start the tool:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 5: Follow the Instructions

Once the script is running, you will be prompted to input either a phone number or an IP address. Follow the on-screen instructions to retrieve the information.

### Notes

- Make sure you have an active internet connection to access the APIs.
- If you are using an external API (e.g., NumVerify), you will need to sign up for an API key and replace the placeholder key in the script.
